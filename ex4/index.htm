                    <p> Swift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her <em self-titled album in 2006.> </em> Her next, <em> Fearless </em> (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence. <em Speak Now (2010) > </em>incorporated rock influences, while <em Red (2012) > </em> experimented with electronic elements and featured <strong Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together".> </strong> She departed from her country image with <em 1989 (2014),></em> a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored <em> Reputation </em> (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.

She spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients. She identifies as a Christian. She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters, before transferring to the Wyndcroft School. The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School. She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.
    </p>
    <h3 id="titulo4" > 2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album </h3>
    <p> In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose called the sessions <q> some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. <strong>She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks. </strong> </q> </p>
    <section>
        <p> 
            <em> Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house </em>, but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists and recalled: <q>I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.</q>
